Hi Dr. Louie,

Sorry for missing the update last week. Because I was installing the environment for spinning up, which is a GitHub project I would like to start RL practice. However, the environment is somehow problematic and my UBUNTU system was broken in fact...

But right now everything has been set up and works properly, and I could run some examples from the tutorial. And I read through some example codes to understand how to build a policy network as well as how to run one epoch of training.

Also, I read through the paper you sent Social Cues in the Autonomous Navigation of Indoor Mobile Robots, it combines the force model with the geometric approach to find the optimal gap in the environment. I think it should be classified as a traditional approach for robot navigation since no learning is used in this research. But another paper Crowd-Robot Interaction: Crowd-aware Robot Navigation with Attention-based Deep Reinforcement Learning mentioned the social force model, and I am not sure if it could be combined with reward function and MDP so that it can also be implemented with learning.

Also, from reading papers, I think I still need to learn some about Machine Learning, since it seems that the papers I read are all about Deep Reinforcement Learning, and some basic terminologies like pooling are still strange to me. I already registered for a course in deep reinforcement learning on Udacity so that I can start this topic also.

Again, really sorry for missing the updates last week, since installing the environment is really time-consuming and I didn't make too much progress that week.

Thank you,
Hao
