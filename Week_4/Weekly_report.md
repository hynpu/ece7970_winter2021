In this week, I followed the Chapter 1-5 in the textbook: [Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On), which gives lots of theory background and practices about RL. And I have really learned a lot from it, as weel as recap the basic knowledge regarding neural network and reinforcement learning.

1. It introduced the OpenAI Gym, which provides different training scenarios for our RL
2. It gave an introduction of PyTorch, and I also followed a tuitorial [DEEP LEARNING WITH PYTORCH: A 60 MINUTE BLITZ](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html), and learned the basic concepts, operations about Tensor, and forward propogation and backward propogation
3. What does the the convolution layer do, why we need the ReLU layer, and why we need to have the Linear layer at the end.
4. It gave 3 example of the RL algorithm, which is Crossentropy, a model free, policy based, and on policy algorithm. The Neual Network contains lienar, Relu, and linear layer, to convert the input (observation from OpenAI Gym) to action probability distribution. And the loss function is from the CrossEntropyLoss() class. Which I need to learn the physical meaning.
5. Read several papers, and compared the similarity and difference. The paper *Crowd-Robot Interaction Crowd-Aware Robot Navigation With Attention-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning* can be pretty illuminating, and after reading the textbook, I can understand how the research in the paper was processed. The notes of these papers are in the week 4 folder also.

In the next week, I will keep reading the book *https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On*, and go thought the deep Q learning, which is the main focus for the next chapters. I really think this book is written in a good way so that every reader can follow it's tutorial from scratch. Also, since the pytorch on my virtual machine still has some problem (it works in my spinningup environment, but after I created a new environment for this testbook only, and I need to set up the pytorch inside the environment, and it seems to have some glitch, and didn't work well), I will try to solve these problems and run the examples given by this textbook.
