* Cons of imitation learning: if the agent finds itself in a state that is not part of the training data.

A very conclusive way to explain DQN:
In Deep Q-learning [15], the optimal value function is approximated with a neural network Q^\*(s; a) Q(s; a; \theta) with parameters \theta. The action value function is learned by iteratively minimizing the error between the expected return and the state-action value predicted by the network
