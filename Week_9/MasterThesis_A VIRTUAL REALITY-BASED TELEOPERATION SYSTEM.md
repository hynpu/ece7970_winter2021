# Abstract
This dissertation introduced the the PEPPER robot operating system (how to use it, what's the difference between the app and VR LfD), and then introduced the Inverse Kinematics Model of PEPPER, which includes the Inv Kinematics matrics from equation shoulder to HMD, from HMD to Origin, from Controller to Origin, and from Controller to Elbow. All these transformation matrics will be used to compute the position/rotation of head, hand, elbow, and shoulder. Also, the dissertation introduced the approach to compare therapist training time, efficiency, performance, and perceptions between Inv Kinematics model and SoftBank Choregraphe.

Moreover, it detailed introduced how to perform the experiment, from Day 1 to Day 3: how to train the robot, how to interact with children with ASD, and how to compare the results using System Usability Scale (SUS) and NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).

# Spotlight

The Inverse Kinematics Model is very helpful for understanding the robot algorithm on Github
