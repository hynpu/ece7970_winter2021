Hi Dr. Louie,

In the past week, except for studying some CPP skills (some fields i realized that I am not pretty familiar with when I followed your video lectures), I was also following the lessons from Udacity as I mentioned.

After lesson 7, I learned the basics of Q learning based on the TD method (TD0, TD1, TD lambda and related knowledge), the mathematical proof of convergence of Q learning, and the Value Iteration vs the Policy Iteration, and how to adjust the reward function to avoid suboptimally and so on.

I think I was kind of struggling with the mathematical equations since I always want to fully understand them. I am not sure if it is a good habit because not only it could be very time-consuming, but also it seems that I will understand the whole idea as long as I follow the lecture, even if I didn't understand some parts of it. 

Except for following the video lectures on Udacity, I also go through the paper you send to me. I kind of having the feeling that how should I make my own research, because I noticed that one of the papers you sent to me (Social Cues in the Autonomous Navigation of Indoor Mobile Robots) is almost combining two different methods and develop his own research. And I definitely need to read more papers in different fields, so that at least I know which fields are related and could be somehow combined together.

I also have a question that, which approach you think would be a better way to learn and do research: should I finish the whole video lectures and related book knowledge, then reading more papers, and mimic open-sourced RL projects? Or can I start the latter two stages without learning most of RL knowledge? (Some people said you can just work on the project without knowing a lot since you will learn when you read the code, but I feel like it is only true when learning data structure and algorithm stuff....)

Best,
Hao
